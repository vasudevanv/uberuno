<h1>&Uuml;ber uno | Uno on steroids</h1>

&Uuml;ber uno is a modified version of the classic Uno card game. There are several additions including 
new cards and some wacky gameplay.

## Gameplay

Each round or "hand" consists of the rules for a basic Uno game plus a 
"Wild Ones" rule, the "Fast Eddy" and a combination of several addon rules
which are determined by the dealer of that particular hand.  In &Uuml;ber Uno, there
is no winner; only one loser.  The goal of the game is to not be the last loser
of the day, aka the "Nappy".

## Basic Rules

* The direction of play is determined by the way the dealer deals the cards.

* The number of cards dealt is at the discrestion of the dealer.

* If a player must draw if they do not have a card to play when it is their turn.  They have the option to play the
  a card until they verbally elect to "Pass".

* A card is not considered played until it is face up on the table and fully released from the hand (or fingers) 
  of the individual playing the card.

* When a draw card is played, including Majors and Minors (Wild Draw 4 and Draw 2 cards, respectively), the next player
  in turn must draw unless they play the same type of draw card.  The draw cards are cumulative, 
  so the last player to be hit by a draw card must draw for every draw card that was thrown in that sequence.

* A player must declare when they have "Uno" before another player asks them "How 
  many cards do you have", else the player must draw a 2 card penalty.

* A hand comes to an end as soon as one player is out of cards. At the end of 
  the hand the player with the highest points is the loser of the hand. The 
  scoring system goes as follows

     * All classic cards except 0's count as 1 point.
     * Change Hands and Player Cards (e.g. Jimmy Jazz Hands) count as 2 points.
     * The &Uuml;ber card counts as 4 cards and the Joker counts as -1.
     * If two players are tied with the same number of cards, the one with 
       more word cards (i.e., cards that are not numbered 2 through 9) loses 
       the hand
     * If two players are tied with the same number of cards and same number 
       of word cards, then all number cards are tallied and the person with the highest number is the loser.
     * If the players remain tied in number count, a draw-off from the top of the stack takes place. 
       The player to draw the highest card loses the hand.

* The player who loses a hand becomes the dealer for the next hand

* At the end of the day, there are no winners, only "Nappies" a.k.a the 
  player who lost the last hand of the day.

* A player playing a draw 4 card can be challenged to check if he does not 
  have the color that is in play. 
 
     * If card information is given away on a challenge, the player being 
       challenged may either give one card to the offending player, or take 
       any one card from the offending player (being able to look at their 
       cards in choosing).
     * On a challenge, when card information is given away about a player 
       on "Uno", that player may go out by giving the challenging player that 
       card.

## The Cards

<img src="assets/img/cards_1.png"  width="600">

### Ultimate Joker
<img align="right" src="assets/img/joker.svg" height="200">

The Ultimate Joker can be used for multiple purposes.  If a player is on the 
receiving end of a draw card, the Joker can be used to reverse direction of play 
and cause the other player to draw the cards instead.  In the case of a 
major being the last card played, the player who now has to draw the cards 
calls the color for the next card. The Joker is also the only card that can 
block the <span>&Uuml;ber</span>.  It cannot be requested by a player
who is fishing.

### Uber
<img align="right" src="assets/img/uber.svg" height="200">
The <span>&Uuml;ber</span> card when played allows the player who played the 
card to exchange his hand with any of the other players. The hand exchange 
is mandatory ans hence the card cannot be used to go out.  

### Change Hands
<img src="assets/img/changehands.svg" width="600">
This card can be played to change hands with any other player at the table.  The play can be blocked
if the requested player plays a change hands card.

### Player Cards
* There are two cards in the deck which are a tribute to players at the table. These cards can only be played by their rightful owners.
* Currently, they are the "Ashley Pouty Face" and the "Abominable SnowBob" cards.
* If a player is in posession of both cards, they may play both cards at once in turn and go directly to uno 
  by choosing a card from their hand and discarding the remaining cards.


## Default addons

### Fast Eddy
* Any player can play out of turn if they "Fast Eddy" by throwing the same card as the last card thrown.
     * Players can Fast Eddy the last card at any point before the original player in turn plays.
     * The player in turn may touch a draw pile, aka "Deck Tap" to prevent the Fast Eddy.
     * In the event that a player Fast Eddy's a card at the same time as the player in turn,
       tie goes to the runner, aka the player in turn.
     * As a consequense of this rule, if a player has multiples of the same card, they may play stack the cards and play
       play them at the same time.

### Go Fish
* A zero can be played to ask another player for any card of their choosing, except for the Joker.
* The targeted player may block the request with their own zero.
* If the player does not have the card requested, the requesting player must draw from the pile.


## Wild Ones
All 1's are wild and they can be played independent of color. Each "1" card has a specific action
detailed below.  While the magnitude of the action is dependent on the rules for that hand,
the action of each color 1 card is the same. Any 1 card can be blocked by any other player 
by throwing down a 1 of the same color. The action will be reinstated if any player throws aother 1 of the same
color.

### Old School
Under the old school rules, the magnitude of action for the 1's is one.

#### Red One – The Red Hot Chili Pepper Card
* When played, the player of the card removes one card from his hand and 
  places it face down on he table and gives it to one other player.
* If the player of the card shows the card to any other player while giving it away, 
  the receiving player may deny the card and request another. 
* If a Red One is the turn card at the start of the game, the dealer will 
  give away one of his cards (unless blocked). 
* At the end of the game, the Red One counts as one word card.

#### Yellow One – The Confusing One
* Can be played at any time including when hit with a draw card, but cannot 
  be played to go out. 
* When played during a normal turn, the player turns in his cards to the 
  bottom of the draw pile and takes an equal number of cards from the top of 
  the draw pile (the number equal to the number in his hand following the 
  discard of the yellow one).
* When played following a draw card, the person playing the card draws a card
  from the draw pile and the action is taken based on the drawn card. If the 
  drawn card is 
    * Numbered Card : The player draws that many cards.
    * Major : The next player in turn draws 4 plus the original # of draw cards.
    * Minor : The next player in turn draws 2 plus the original # of draw cards.
    * Reverse : The player who threw the draw card on the player of the yellow one must draw the original # cards.
    * Skip : The next player in turn draws the original # of cards.
    * Change Hands : The player draws the original # of cards and change his entire hand with another player.  It can be blocked by the receiving player.
    * Wild : The player draws the original # of cards and then changes hands.  It cannot be blocked by the receiving player unless they have a joker.
    * Yellow #1 : Blocks the original Yellow #1.

* If a Yellow One is the turn card, the dealer must exchange his entire 
  hand for an equal number of cards from the top of the deck (unless blocked).
* You cannot go out on the Yellow One. 
* The Yellow One can be blocked by any player, and can be re-instated by any 
  player. During normal play, the next player’s play ends the period of time 
  in which the card can be blocked or re-instated. When played as a result 
  of a draw card, the touch of the pile by the playing player ends the 
  period of time in which the card can be blocked or re-instated. 
* At the end of the game, the Yellow One counts as one word card.

#### Blue One – The Danger Card
* Can be played at any time except to go out and except when hit with a 
  draw card. 
* When played, hands are changed by passing each hand one position in the 
  current direction of play.
* If a Blue One is the turn card, hands are exchanged in the order of play 
  unless it is blocked. 
* The Blue One can be blocked, and can be re-instated by any player. The 
  next player’s play ends the period of time in which the card can be 
  blocked or re-instated. 
* At the end of the game, the Blue One counts as one word card.

#### Green One – The Repo Card 
* Can be played at any time except to go out and except when hit with a draw card. 
* When played, the player of the card is entitled to select any one card 
  from the discard pile and add it to his hand. Play continues to the next 
  person after the card selection is complete (the selected card cannot be 
  played during that turn). The Green One just played cannot be selected, 
  but a Green One played previously can be. 
* If a Green One is the turn card, the dealer will add that card to his 
  hand unless blocked.
* The Green One can be blocked, and can be re-instated by any player. The 
  next player’s play ends the period of time in which the card can be blocked
  or re-instated. 
* At the end of the game, the Green One counts as one word card. 

### Russian
The action of the ones remains the same as old school, except the magnitude of their action is determined by "Russian Roulette", i.e., the player flips a card from the top of the draw pile and this determines the magnitude of the action.

#### Red One
To determine the number of cards to give away the player flips a card from the top of the deck until a numbered card is reached. If the number is greater than the number of cards in the player's hand, the player must draw up to that number of cards. 

#### Yellow One
The player flips a card from the top of the deck and the consequences are as follows
If the drawn card is 
  * Numbered Card : The player exchanges their hand for that many cards.
  * Major : The player exchanges their hand for 4 more cards than they originally had
  * Minor : The player exchanges their hand for 2 more cards than they originally had
  * Reverse : The player exchanges their hand for as many cards as the previous player has in their hand.
  * Skip : The player exchanges theur hand for as many cards as the next player has in their hand.
  * Change Hands : The player draws the original # of cards and changes 
    their entire hand with another player.  It can be blocked by the receiving player.
  * Wild : The player exchanges their hand for the same # of cards and then changes hands.  It cannot be blocked by the
    receiving player unless they have the joker.
  * Yellow #1 : Blocks the original Yellow #1.

### Buddy system
The rules are the same as Russian, but instead of flipping a card, the next player in turn determines the magnitude of the player's wild one card by playing a card from his/her hand. The next player resumes play after action is taken on the wild one, playing off of the card they played for their buddy.

## Optional addons

### Pinwheel
Players can play a stack of the same card type regardless of color so long as the bottom card plays in turn.  For 
example, if a player has a blue seven, a red seven and a yellow seven, they may play all three cards at once 
assuming the card on bottom plays on the previous color or the previous number.  The top card becomes the 
card for the next player to play on.

### Math rules
Players may use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with number cards to achieve the desired number.
* Number cards must be of the same color in order to play.
* Math functions may only be used to Fast Eddy or to match the previous number played (i.e. a calculated number 
  may not be played outright to eliminate cards from the player's hand more quickly).
* Derived math functions, such as averages, may be used if declared by the dealer at the beginning of the hand.

### Michael Jackson Minors
Players can Fast Eddy minors, regardless of color.  For example, a blue minor may be played out of turn 
on a red minor.

### Jumping Jimmy's
Minors and majors can be used to propagate the action of each other. You cannot Fast Eddy a minor with a major or vice versa.

### Macchu Picchu
Any player who plays the zero card must ask everyone at the table for their card of choice.  Players may 
elect to block with a zero if they have one. For every player that does not have the card of choice that was asked, the asker draws a card from the deck.

### Picchu Macchu
Essentially the reverse of the Macchu Picchu rule. Any player who plays the zero card must ask everyone at the table for their card of choice.  Players may elect to block with a zero if they have one. If a player does not have the card that was asked, he draws a card from the deck.

### Additive
For Russian or Buddy System, additive allows for any player to add onto the magnitude card if they have the same card.  
For example, if a player flips a green 6, any other player can play a green 6.  In this case, the magnitude of the 
wild one then becomes 12. 1's are still color agnostic, so if the player flips a green 1, any other player can play a 1 of any color.

### Cards gone Wild
Wild cards can be played as any card except the Joker or the Uber

### Doos
The player calls "doos" when he gets down to two cards. If on a turn a player on doos cannot play a card
from their hand, they call "upperdecker" and flip a card from the top of the deck. They draw cards based on
the following rules
  * Numbered Card : The player draws that many cards.
  * Major : The player draws 5 cards 
  * Minor : The player draws 3 cards 
  * Reverse : The player draws as many cards as the previous player has in their hand.
  * Skip : The player draws as many cards as the next player has in their hand.
  * Change Hands : The player draws one card and changes their entire hand with another player.  It can be blocked by the receiving player.
  * Wild : The player draws one card and then changes hands.  It cannot be blocked by the receiving player unless they have the joker.

### Rotate
Each time a reverse is played you rotate hands in the direction of play. If multiple reverses are played by the same player then the number of places you rotate by increases, i.e., if two reverses are played you change hands with the person 2 places in the direction of play. if 3 reverses are played, then you rotate hands by 3 places in the opposite direction of play.  A player can fast eddy and either add to or cancel a reverse. The rotation can be blocked by a joker.
